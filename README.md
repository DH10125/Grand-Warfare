- **Reward Quality**: Cards found further from spawn edges tend to be more powerful
- **Strategic Depth**: Choose your path carefully to maximize card collection while maintaining tactical position

## Deploying to Vercel

This project is configured for easy deployment to Vercel:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Import your repository to Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and deploy your game
4. Your game will be live at `your-project.vercel.app`

**Important**: Make sure your Vercel project settings are configured correctly:
- **Framework Preset**: Next.js
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (default)
- **Output Directory**: Leave empty (Next.js manages this automatically)
- **Node.js Version**: 18.x or higher (automatically detected from `.node-version`)

If you encounter 404 errors after deployment:
1. Check that the build succeeded in the Vercel deployment logs
2. Clear the deployment cache and redeploy
3. Ensure no custom Vercel project settings override the defaults

Alternatively, you can deploy using the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js 15**: React framework for production
